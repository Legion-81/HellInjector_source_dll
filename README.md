# HellJect

Simple injection method source with the DLL that can be modified for any game really. You can use cheat engine to find the base address and offsets in order to modify memoery inside the dll file. It's really simple and some anticheats may not like this kind of injection method. but this is just an example but works well for the game WIZARDIDLE on STEAM for the time being unless its probably updated where the offsets change.
